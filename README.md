## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your machine:
* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (comes with Node.js)
* MongoDB (or a MongoDB Atlas connection string)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend Server:**
    ```sh
    cd server
    npm install
    ```
    Create a file named `.env` in the `server` directory and add your environment variables:
    ```env
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    ```

3.  **Set up the Frontend Client:**
    ```sh
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server** (from the `/server` directory):
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the frontend client** (from the `/client` directory):
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The React application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port).
